# elementorium
Elementorium is an open-source mini self-sustaining biosphere built on the five natural elements—earth, water, fire, air, and lightning—as necessary conditions for life. It integrates science, art, and sustainability, modeling closed-loop ecosystems for research, education, and future life-support innovations.
